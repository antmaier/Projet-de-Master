	abstract = {Peptides and proteins have been found to possess an inherent tendency to convert from their native functional states into intractable amyloid aggregates. This phenomenon is associated with a range of increasingly common human disorders, including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, type II diabetes, and a number of systemic amyloidoses. In this review, we describe this field of science with particular reference to the advances that have been made over the last decade in our understanding of its fundamental nature and consequences. We list the proteins that are known to be deposited as amyloid or other types of aggregates in human tissues and the disorders with which they are associated, as well as the proteins that exploit the amyloid motif to play specific functional roles in humans. In addition, we summarize the genetic factors that have provided insight into the mechanisms of disease onset. We describe recent advances in our knowledge of the structures of amyloid fibrils and their oligomeric precursors and of the mechanisms by which they are formed and proliferate to generate cellular dysfunction. We show evidence that a complex proteostasis network actively combats protein aggregation and that such an efficient system can fail in some circumstances and give rise to disease. Finally, we anticipate the development of novel therapeutic strategies with which to prevent or treat these highly debilitating and currently incurable conditions.},

	abstract = {Numerous ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+) proteins form hexameric, ring-shaped complexes that function via ATPase-coupled translocation of substrates across the central channel. Cryo-electron microscopy of AAA+ proteins processing substrate has revealed non-symmetric, staircase-like hexameric structures that indicate a sequential clockwise/2-residue step translocation model for these motors. However, for many of the AAA+ proteins that share similar structural features, their translocation properties have not yet been experimentally determined. In the cases where translocation mechanisms have been determined, a two-residue translocation step-size has not been resolved. In this review, we explore Hsp104, ClpB, ClpA and ClpX as examples to review the experimental methods that have been used to examine, in solution, the translocation mechanisms employed by AAA+ motor proteins. We then ask whether AAA+ motors sharing similar structural features can have different translocation mechanisms. Finally, we discuss whether a single AAA+ motor can adopt multiple translocation mechanisms that are responsive to different challenges imposed by the substrate or the environment. We suggest that AAA+ motors adopt more than one translocation mechanism and are tuned to switch to the most energetically efficient mechanism when constraints are applied.},

              ATP synthase in mitochondria and most bacteria is energized by the proton motive force (
              pmf
              ) established and maintained by respiratory chain enzymes. Conversely, in the presence of ATP and in the absence of a
              pmf
              , the enzyme works as an ATP-driven proton pump. Here, we investigate how high concentrations of ATP affect the enzymatic activity of the F

              ATP synthase under high
              pmf
              conditions, which is the typical situation in mitochondria or growing bacteria. Using the ATP analogue adenosine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) (ATPαS), we have developed a modified luminescence-based assay to measure ATP synthesis in the presence of millimolar ATP concentrations, replacing an assay using radioactive nucleotides. In inverted membrane vesicles of
              E. coli
              , we found that under saturating
              pmf
              conditions, ATP synthesis was reduced to {\textasciitilde}10\% at 5 mM ATPαS. This reduction was reversed by ADP, but not P
              i
              , indicating that the ATP/ADP ratio controls the ATP synthesis rate. Our data suggests that the ATP/ADP ratio {\textasciitilde}30 in growing
              E. coli
              limits the ATP synthesis rate to {\textasciitilde}20\% of the maximal rate possible at the applied
              pmf
              and that the rate reduction occurs via product inhibition rather than an increased ATP hydrolysis rate.},
