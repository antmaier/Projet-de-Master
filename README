# Exploration of possible structure-based models of the mechanism of action of AAA+ ATPases
Antoine Maier's Master's project for the degree of Master of Science MSc in Physics.
EPFL, fall semester, 2023-24
Supervisor: Prof. Paolo De Los Rios

Run ´Code/experiments.ipynb´ to see the experiments (more info in the report).
In this notebook, there is a GUI that dynamically updates the plots.
The translocation models are defined in ´Code/translocation_models.py´, and the GUI as well as the experiments are defined in ´Code/experiments.py´.

Read the report for more info about the project, and my contact info.
